# ðŸ“Œ Overview :
This project is a machine learning fraud detection model built and trained using python , deployed on Gradio and streamlit

Fraud drains billions of dollars each year , itâ€™s methods just keep getting better and better. What if we can detect and stop these fraudulent transactions from even happening . Prevention is not just cheaper than recovery â€” itâ€™s smarter.

## Features:
1. Multiple models trained to get highest recall,precision , and f1-score.

2. Deployed on Streamlit and gradio.

3. A docker file is included to be built.
